## Learning Experience

Throughout this project, I gained valuable insights into effectively handling API routing for both the admin and user sides. A highlight was deploying the project on Vercel and troubleshooting various issues. Leveraging TypeScript and ESLint helped me detect unused data and deprecated libraries, enhancing the overall quality of the application.
